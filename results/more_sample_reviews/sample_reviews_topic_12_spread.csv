49,When i graduated i was so happy!....no not because i was out of school but because i was out of her class.
98,well now that im in high school mrs ericcson messed up my whole year...in algerbra we didnt even get to the 2nd book putting me way behind in geomertry
147,My son came home upset after nearly every class because she would pick on him before anyone else.
196,He was so abnoxious! I got an A in the class but thats only because of Ms. B! She should be conducting NOT him! He never let us out of class on time!
245,Half way through the year she still didnt know my name. my average was a 27 and it was because she put all my grades under someone elses name since she didnt know mine. It was an awful year
294,mrs northrup is very unorganized she messed up my grade and my friends gave me a detention for being tardy when shes tardy in the morning and everyone waits outside her class room for 5-10min
343,i remembered when i was in 6th grade and i got into Arista and she told me that i didnt deserve it just because i didnt understand something in class. ugh i still remember that....
392,she is so negative. Every day we just enter the classroom and she starts yelling st us. I wish we had MRs. Hutteman.
441,"I did all the work and I didn't pass. Did not have grades, she passed only eight out of ten students. Started out with 25 and left with ten. Have to retake 096 but I have a different teacher and I am passing that class."
490,"She was pretty much awful the entire year. as soon as i left her math class i was extatic, and when i walked in her room one day i forgot everything. thanks to ms.emanuel i got a 600 o my math SOL"
539,You gave me my first F even though I worked real hard and it discouraged me the rest of the year. Now I am behind STILL in 9th. -.- I cant get caught up.
588,"SHE'S HARD, SHE'S A BAD TEACHER... AND EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO HER EVERY ADVISORY FOR HELP... I STILL FAILED THE CLASS..."
637,"We are the first class he has taught after 6 years. Let's just say that what he ""teaches"" does not stay in our minds for weeks to come."
686,"WAS GIVING MY GOOD GRADES TO ANOTHER STUDENT THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER. WHEN I ASKED HER ABOUT IT,SHE GOT MAD AND SAID IT WAS MY FAULT,CUZ OF OUR ALIKE LAST NAME"
735,I had Mr.Piteris a couple years ago and he was one of the worst teachers I ever had he just gave us labs that we had to do in under a week and he was absent 3 out of the 5 days in the week that we had school and when he did show up he just sat at his computer and slept I had a failing average in his class until I got a tutor and he helped me raise my grade from a F to a C+ and when ever you asked him a question he just says to go to extra help and there he even just stares at his computer.THANKS
784,"I am a sophmore at SRHS now and i can finally get away from this guy. He subbed for about a month in 8th grade, and everyone in the class bombed the test. It almost kept me from getting to go on the ECT.PS: He has sweaty armpits"
833,I never even saw her at all until junior year. Completely uninvolved with the school and doesn't even make an effort to help students.
882,I hated her! I had her for homeroom and she wouldn't let us leave during STAR for anything not even the bathroom! She found out who my friends boy friend was and always bugged her about him!
931,"Had her last year (i'm in 6th grade) She never let us do our own work, we always had to do it her way"
980,got my schedule and it said hunter i was so happy until someone told me it was k hunter i wanted not j. argh.
1029,2 me u r sooo boring. but i had da best sleep in ur class. I am soo happy i transferred out of ur class after 3 days.
1078,the worst teacher i've ever had. she didnt even teach and i ended up having trouble in algebra 2 after i took this class
1127,Last year was a good class but coming into this year i expected so much more. You have changed as a teaher and your personality has changed a lot.
1176,"wow mr. Icavano it was so e-z to getout of class and out of school with you, thanks here's a hint i have been in your office every month in 05 to 06 year, yeah its me the _______ I was in Kestlingers"
1225,He got suspended....... and I'm learning more on the 1st day then i did throughout the whole year with him
1274,I missed a test cuzz I was out of town then he had all of these subs so I couldn't make up my test when he came back he said it was 2 late to make up the test!!
1323,"lots of time to do homework, i sure did. but people really fall asleep, and my friend never got a referall...in 6th grade! but this year, she gave my friend bucket duty for 2 weeks"
1372,"september 23rd, 20,000. the year was 20,000 for a whole week. we WATCHED her write it... oh and i skipped her class 19 times freshman year and got caught once. by the sub."
1422,"I have never met someone so unbelievably stupid. had her twice and never learned a thing. My friends and I copied each other's tests identically and we each got different grades. Not even close to similar. The one the slept every class got a 90, the one that actually knew what he was doing got an 80, and the two that worked their butts off but still didnt understand got a 60 and a 65...what?..."
1471,wow....what an interesting woman. she needs to retire...FAST. its was semester and she still didn't know people's names. she could never remembered what she taught us
1520,this guy hardly showed up for work my goodness come on i mean all we learned about is bach last time i saw him he was at fharrel
1569,we watched a movie the last day of school when all the other global language classes didnt have to come so we walked out and he wrote us up. thanks a lot pajor
1618,She doesn't even know whats goin on in her class. One boy got his head busted and she wasn't even there.
1667,WORST TEACHER EVER!I had 90s in math EVEry yEAr this year i fail midterm and he REFUSED to go over it then kicked me out into the hall when i asked why..if u get him GET OUT NOW!!!
1716,grr.... i dont like him... he doesnt help u and he also gave me bad grades. he gave me two b's on my report card.. i dont like him hes to strict
1765,"I had Ms. Bobeck last year and I didn't learn a thing. I failed the last four tests and still got an A in the class, ha what a great teacher! *rolls eyes*"
1814,"This teacher tought me in 7th grade @ home ec and she told us stuff her friends told her, not facts. I think she needs 2 go back 2 school 2 learn more."
1863,Chapman was horrible. i missed one hw and she called my parents and told them lies about me. she hated me and favored all the brainiacs in the class. no help
1912,"Dude, not a good vice principal. I remember he kept saying marcella's name wrong. I guess he was nice, as long as he wasn't yelling."
1961,Really confusing if you don't have friends in your class. Never knew what was going on for the first half of the year.
2010,He was awful. I had him last year. He started screaming at our class and another teacher had to come in and calm him down.
2059,I took 3 years of french in high school and my last year i had mr. teahan. I am now in french 101 in college and i still am having a hard time because i forgot everything thanks to this class. Horrible class.
2108,"He called us ""douchebags"" and ""assholes"". On the first day he told us ""you're probably not brilliant if you're in this class."" He made a sixteen-year-old girl cry, and he made a girl in my class who had just moved from China and knew less than rudimentary English read complex scientific passages. It was his first year of teaching, so maybe he's changed, but this was my experience."
2157,"SWITCH OUT NOW. I asked for help every single time I needed it but was denied. Finally, when the whole class insisted, she was very unclear and difficult."
2206,I HATE!!! mrs.mcqueen she talked on and on and blamed kids for things we didnt even do! im so glad i dont have her anymore! she gives homework at the last week of the school!!she is awful!
2255,"She is an awful woman. My son comes home upset everyday, and he finally told me why. He said it was MS.backes. I didn't think it was anything big, so I left it alone. About a week later he called me and told me that she screamed at him, and that he had to file a BULLY REPORT on her. I talked to him and he didn't want me to email HER because he said she would send him to the principles office, like she did to another child. I talked to the school and they said they would talk to her, but..."
2304,she is the worst!!!!!!!!!!!! she made me come into her office 4 times because she forgot she already met with me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :(
2353,"This year she had eye surgery so everyones feeling bad for her when she comes in and all she does in complain again. I cant stand her anymore, if you get her instead of mayercheck in 7th, get switched"
2402,okay...well...she is OK but she talks with her teeth. she told my friend to stop nagging when she relly needed help with her math. :(
2451,i just have her for homeroom but she does unnessesary things like yelling at you three times even when you do nothing wrong
2500,"MR THAYER!!! I had mr. thayer in 7th grade, He taught my dad and my uncle, and my brother. So I guess hes been teaching for a while :) he was a great teacher."
2549,Thanks for the 52 on the lab mrs. copeland. Ill try to remeber the half-life of popcorn kernals next time
2598,Anybody that actually had her at one point knew what an unhelpful teacher she was. So glad I dont have her anymore.
2647,"Has never helped me, forgets my name, and doesn't teach. My spanish has gone downhill since he became my teacher. Thanks, Mr. Moreau"
2696,she only walks around doing nothing thats the whole thing yelling and screaming blah blah blah blah blah who cares anymore. Do your work do this yeah right!
2745,"Brannum was the hardest teacher i had over 4 yrs at TC, i took bio without honors and i still i rececived the lowest grade i ve had in all 4 yrs. for my 10th to 11th grade, i had all A s in everything. Everyone told me to switch to Fick and i thought everyone who said that just can't work hard enough, but i ended up with a low grade even though i tried."
2794,She talks way too much about her nails. We were trying to cheer one of my friend up because she was upset. Everything was going fine until... Mrs. Pugh came barging in. Made my friend her feel worse.
2844,"She has a bad personality. she is ok,now that it is the end of the year. But in the bigging. She never teaches anything she is not helpful. Now She is moving to 8 Grade I better not HAVE HER AGAIN."
2893,She is too harsh for a 2nd grade teacher. She made me flat out cry the only time I ever have to this day at school.
2942,I aced every assignment and test. I missed two hours of class. He gave me a B- because I wouldn't stay after my graduation four an extra four hours.
2991,ms. martinez is the worst teacher i've ever had. she yelled at me all the time for no reason at all and one time she even made me cry. i hated seventh grade because of her.
3040,I had the worst time in her class! She isn't leniant at all to anything even excused medical abcenses. If you begin to fall behind she has no way to recover notes and just recommends that you drop the class! I believe I would have understood algebra 2 better if I had a teacher willing to work with me from the start of the year.
3089,"I had Mr. Bella last year, he's hard, sometimes very unclear...but in the end, you do good...I mean I got a 90 on the regents, so at least he helped me there..."
3138,"She is sometimes good, and extremely easy. She doesn't grade that way though. I never got a 4. Also, the 8th Grade DVD. What a joke!!!!!!! You'll never recieve it. Sorry little kids!!!"
3187,"hey, you can get into the desks from both sides!!! yeah, that about summed up the calibur of that class. There was no teaching involved. You had better already know the stuff, or you'd fail. I got mad enough that I dropped it at the semester."
3236,One of the other teachers in the school told me not to listin to what Mrs. I said because she was probably wrong. I have to agree with the teacher who told me this. Sorry Mrs. I but your better at 3rd
3285,"HATE HER. I only have her for homeroom, and I think that she is out to get me. I was walking to history one day, and she yelled at two people who were rushing to class next to me, and told them they should be hurrying."
3334,You know that when 7 out of 11 students fail a class there is something wrong. The students ended up trying to teach each other becaus eshe was never there.
3383,He gave the class Es on a project because he thought we cheated. He is my least favorite teacher I have had.
3432,She is mean and at 1st she was allright but now we aren't even allowed to talk in advisory but she is only a sub but this could be permenent!:(
3481,"You call yourself a teacher, ha. I am going to be so screwed next year in geometry preap because you haven't taught us anything!!!"
3530,"she is the worst teacher i have ever had,because when my friend was talking, she told ME to be quiet, and then my friend confessed that she was the one talking, and camille barre told her that she didn't care. So i got in trouble."
3579,"interesting class to say the least.. I think I failed.. See, I dont even remember the class.. Oh well.. She is a wonderful person!"
3628,she gave tests very frequently on information that was scarcely taught in class and criticized us on homework that we had no clue on how to complete and frequently sent people out into the hall for no reason and when they didn't know what we learned in class they had to continuously go into the hall until they were so far behind that they were kept after school until they were caught up and then the cycle repeated
3677,"20 years ago, I almost didn't graduate because of this teacher. Luckily I aced my final and didn't have to spend another year with him."
3726,he gave everyone 100 extra bonus points on a test if they rode the bus. he gave someone detention for saying bye class when he was going to the bathroom. hes so annoying.
3775,"WORST teacher ive ever had. 6th grade LAL? Got A's and A 's. 7th grade with Ms. Schmidt? She told me I was writing 4th grade material and gave me c's and D's. Took a tutoring class over the summer from a professional writer, who told me that my writing was highschool level, even though i was only in 8th grade. Go to 8th grade with Ms. Schmidt? Says my work and everyone else's is garbage and gives me more C's and D's. SHE LOVES THE PASSAGES CLASS. Always gives them A's."
3824,you can get along with him if you are on the football team.he said I disrupted class even tho he & the jocks talked while I was doing my work.
3873,she'z nice but she waz absent alot....sumtymz she az mean....i can't even tell u wat da class sang wen she waz absent.....:-)..
3922,"he's super nice...but doesn't do his job well and messes up a lot of schedules. I got 2 messed up schedules from him, then met with Devries who easily fixed my problems and got it all worked out."
3971,"i've had a passion to go into photography so i took media arts as a prerequisite course. after this year.. i was totally uninspired so i decided to take a completely different art class next year. he would make last minute changes to what seemed like awesome projects at first, to the worst and weirdest projects ever. it was the worst class of the year and everybody had to stay 9th just to finish it. i'm done with him forever, thank the lord, if you ever get him... try your best to get out of it."
4020,"where do i start?? At the moment, the only positive thing i can think of is that i liked how she kept her bird in class. THE END"
4069,'i have a question!' 'yes?-no-write it down! c me after class! c me @ lunch! theres OBVIOUSLY no time 4 questions!' -she never ansers-the end!
4118,"at times has left us in class - forgot he had a class. can say mean/hurtful things. very forgetful, very unorganized, big mood swings"
4167,he threw a temper tantrum on the last day of school last year. hilarious. he pouted his way out of the room.
4217,This lady needs to retire. Told her whole class that they should never take art again because no one was good at it. What is that saying about the school system?
4266,I only gave him one 2 because he's atleast better than schwarz. (message to administration) GIVE US BACK FINE ARTS WEEK
4315,She never wanted to help me when i needed it she always thought i just didnt want to do anything and was lazy but because of her i lost motivation and had to leave school thanks!
4364,has a problem letting kids go to the bathroom when they need to! also doctors dont care bout bladder problems either! unlimited bathroom perks was a good thing in mrs. b's class!!!
4413,"I had Ms. Carpenter years ago, and she was one of the best teachers I have ever had. When I got to college I was more than prepared for a chem class."
4462,"she's rude, she's mean and i wish that noone ever has her as a sub. i, unfortunately, have and it's the worst 90 mins of your day when she subs."
4511,oh my gosh this lady is the worst teacher in the world i mean she took ten pint because i wrote in red pen i have a c and it went to a d in a day i hate her and i hope she retires
4560,"He is a nice person but not a good teacher. I excel in every class but in his class I got a 75 on the regents, my lowest regents grade ever."
4609,"Yeha, hur name is commins. Wuteva. I tink shes an okay teacher. last year she gave alot of homework. now she just gives us stuff."
4658,"He is the funniest substitute teacher ever:
On the first day of school i had him as a sub in sixth grade and he was writing on the board.
He writes his T's like a flipped over E.He does not know how to write the letter t
When"
4707,"Easy class. Bad teacher. She took down all the other reviews of her. Now I know why. My sister had her and said she was bad. I took her and saw for myself. Disorganized, off topic, just bad."
4756,"Leave it to Mrs. Keyson to reuin drama for you, i went in to her class loving drama and now i hate it"
4805,"Where do I even start. Kristine Gordon is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. At least 3 kids have dropped out of this class within the first week. Im in my freshman year and she has not made a good impression on the jmhs student body. She refuses to answer my questions and is a snobby jerk most of the class. She has favorites and is biased. I have no idea why she a still has a job here, she should have been fired before she was even born. I hate this class she should be fired??"
4854,Impartial treatment. Always targeted me and my friend to point out that we were talking even though the entire class was practically SCREAMING. She cusses infrequently and her poor attitude gave me an awful start to school.
4903,"I had her 2 years ago, and still hold a grudge against her.She was very unclear with her teaching and didn't care if you understood. she taught for herself morethan her students."
4903,"I had her 2 years ago, and still hold a grudge against her.She was very unclear with her teaching and didn't care if you understood. she taught for herself morethan her students."
5001,"AWFUL CLASS. i don't think she's a nice person, but i know she's a ROTTEN teacher. Lost three of my assignments and told my mom that I never did them. Should not teach!"
5099,"I had Mr. Rose 8 years ago for Computer Science, and the fact that he passed our tests back in descending order still annoys me. That's just mean."
5197,I don't know what to say... at the begining of the year she was mean to me... then all of the sudden she started acting all nice.(i think she thouught i was going to the counsler)
5295,"In my 9th grade year, I was getting into a little trouble here & there. I had some teachers that were willing to help me stop misbehaving but he only made me want to rebel more. I'm a straight A Senior that still hates him."
5393,This guys sucks still lives with his mom in her basement don't ya bud. Mr. peanut head
5491,I got a better grade in AP calculus last year when I took it with her husband and now I'm reviewing it and I'm getting a worse grade because I dont understand what she's teaching. I feel bad for the kids who are taking the class for a first time this year!
5589,she always took out her personal problems on us...she was texting one day in class and her bf broke up with her and she started to cry in front of us! i think she quit..yay!! dont like her
5688,He was a hard princable he worked well and was good but when it came to bully's he did absolutely nothing when it came to that in fact my son got in trouble for getting bullied
5786,i had her last year and started out liking her. but the second she realized math wasn't my forte she started hating me!! she made me hate math + feel bad.
5884,he isn't a bad person but is the worst as a teacher (cant teach). his test grades are cumulative from the beginning of a semester if you mess one test up that'll haunt you till the end of the semester
5982,she is so mean her tests are super easy and she doesn't teach well. she spends time talking about her college days and is she is super boring. she also has all these pop quizzes. I was absent two days in a row last year when I got back she said pop quiz and I failed and she wouldn't let me retake it. and when you get grades back she doesn't go over them very well.
6080,"She teaches ONLY with songs. When I had to think of a word, I found myself singing the entire song because I didn't remember what the word meant, only it's place in the song."
6178,He told on me to Ms. Willhauck. Ms. Willhauck!!! How could you do that Cleary? I was just joking about the vocab quizes. It was JP anyway not me.
6276,You put my friend in your storage closet because she was absent. Which wasn't cool. You hated me for no reason. At first you seemed okay. But it was all a lie. YOU DONT LOOK LIKE HATSHEPSUT SO STOP.
6374,"She doesn't know what she's talking about. If you took away her notebook, she'd have no idea what to do. It's amazing how she is still teaching."
6472,he gave me 2 citations in one week for doing nothing. but everybody else who talks way more got away sccot free.
6570,If you do your work and are nice shes nice. She flips on random people. Funniest thing ever. Have parties for every little thing. Pay attention in 8th and 9th or youll never get by in 10th with her.
6668,Makes you hate spanish. the first B i got in a foreign lang was from this lady! She wouldnt even let me take the final to bump it up to an A (i was a senior with an 89). did not learn nething frm her
6766,horrible.! let us use cheat sheets so i didnt know anything when i got out of there but i had a b from her every term and knew enough not to go on
6864,"Your labs were pretty fun and all, but everyone got in trouble for the weirdest things. Like in lunch you made me sweep cuz i said 'it's quiet' after you blew the whistle..."
6962,"She's the teacher that reads your paper and says it's really good and then you get it back and it has a 70% on it. She constantly gave students she liked better grades. After stressing the importance of preparation during our speech one girl proceeded to breakdown and cry because she set up her note card wrong. Hakow then decided to give her another chance because she was favorited and gave no other student who messed up another chance because as she said ""I gave you enough time to prepare"""
7061,She is the reason I hated Honors Algebra II. She never really taught...it was just the first five minutes and then she would hand out worksheets and leave us to fend for ourselves.
7159,"Ms. Mcshane is the most evil teacher I have ever had! As of this writing It is exactly two days until the end of the trimester. Not only am I counting the seconds, but I have been looking up stuff about her on Google. I completely RELISHED the sub I had on friday a few days before I posted this. I cant wait for her to retire.Advice:
She'll yell at you about anything wrong you do.
Try to get on her good side if you want to live.
My friend met her alone one time and she was nice for a sec (SCARY"
7257,"Had him in summer. Said like two words a day and muttered to himslelf the rest of the time. He hates teaching, therefore hates kids"
7355,"I have her now and she doesn't teach two S H I T S. At the beginning of the year, she was fine, and I got along with it, but now she sits and tells you to go to tutoring if you had a slip up in an exam. As if that isn't her job. She's a teacher for Christ's sake! Screw her class."
7453,this teacher was aight...cept the time she gave me i.s.s and those flash things are useless and boring
7551,"She was okay. She held a grudge against me the whole year since my friend who sat next to me talked a lot. Honestly, I shouldn't have been punished. She grades unfairly, but I suppose that is how the real world is. None of my friends enjoyed her class either. Good luck, Ms. Baxter."
7649,"I had him when he was still new because it seemed like he didn't know what he was doing at times. Like I remember he would pull exams forward from the original scheduled date. Who does that? Otherwise, I'm sure he is pretty cool now that he got older and more mature."
7747,worst class i ever had at Sallies. She said I was cheating till I proved her wrong. She cant teach but is nice
7845,"Mrs. Hanson used to laugh at and belittle students for asking questions. It was a long time ago that I had her, so I hope she doesn't do that anymore."
7943,"That class was a waste of time. He picks favorites to the extreme. I missed grades by less than ten points both semesters, and every time I tried to talk to him about I got yelled at to get out of the"
8041,"she is the worst teacher I have ever had, i did one thing wrong to make her angry and she held it over me the whole year. Someone she liked would do something not get in trouble, i would do the same thing and get a detentions Ms. Vest is a bad teahcer"
8139,"jesus christ ive never been more bored in my life. if you got by fine in french 3 and got an easy B its really easy to do the same in french 4. i would NOT advise this, though. my french got worse throughout this class."
8237,Omg!U had us turn in notes on movies and then every1 just turned in old journal pragraphs and u said good job.U never found out about the irish putting cakes on their mother in law
8335,Quite possibly one of the WORST teachers at GHS. She picked favorites and only cast her talent-less sons in nearly every damn production. And when my siblings all went through her class she tried to fail them until my parents talked to the school board. My siblings were straight A students and almost lost it because of Dempsey's favoritism. Her methods are outdated. And she needs to be taught manners.
8434,"She snaps at every little thing you do wrong, doesn't explain lessons well, and when I ask her a question, she waits twenty seconds, turns to me and distastefully says, ""What?"" I regret taking guitar"
8532,Mrs. Shankin gives too much work and does not work one on one with her students enough. I remember struggling in her class and my friends have all had similar experiences. I hope that this review encourages her to help her students balance their homework load with their other classes because by the end of the year I stopped doing my homework all together. I think I got a C in her class when I was in 6th grade and I currently have a 3.86 gpa and got an A in every other history class.
8630,"he hated me cuz i talked too much, but when we made a seat change without letting him know, he didnt care. omg, those TICS, i got like 50 of them."
8728,"I had him 20 years ago, and you are all right. Some things never change. How this man is teaching children is beyond me. It is funny and sad to read these reviews."
8826,Mean - always came to first hour late and tired because of her work with her band the night before. Then she took it out on her students.
8924,mr wilhite did not know how to teach math at all!!! he told some interesting stories about himself and now he is gone!!
9022,Horrible counselor. Lazy. Not helpful. Tries to avoid you. Make up excuses to make you leave. To freshman who have her.. good luck
9120,"I had her as a freshmen, and I got an A, but I didn't really like her. She scolded students for no reason, and confused everybody with contradicting herself."
9218,"-2/10 would not recommend. had freshman year. barely survived. scared 97% of the yeat. got really heated about imaginary numbers, don't ask. told us about her job at Wegmans. wasn't a fan of me or my class. does not enjoy when you come in late to class. will drag you even if you have a pass."
9316,"after going to college I realize how horrible Mr.Kelly was at teaching. Like others have said, he was extremely condescending, and gave too much work for a NON-HONORs class! Thank god I graduated."
9414,"hehe where do i start?! once she asked me where my assignment book was an im like "" Its over yander past yer desk!"" i got glared at but it was worth it. XD"
